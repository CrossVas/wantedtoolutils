# About this mod

This mod adds some additional functionality to IC2, Redstone Arsenal (and Redstone Armory as well) and EnderIO tools. Currently it has only one and most wanted feature from Mekanism's Atomic Disassembler - Vein Miner. 
Vein Miner has two modes: 
 - regular mode: used only for ores;
 - extended mode: used for any blocks.

By default it uses regular mode, for Extended mode, sneak right-click while holding the supported tool. 

# Support
 - IC2: Mining Drill, Diamond Drill, Iridium Drill; 
 - Redstone Arsenal: Flux-Infused Pickaxe (Redstone Armory's Enderium Pickaxe works, too);
 - EnderIO: Both Electric and Regular DarkSteel pickaxes (carefully with Travel Anchor Upgrade!!!)
 
# Plans 
 
 - Add torch placement ability to the supported tools? (except IC2 one).
 
# State
 
 - Currently the mod is mostly done as I added all the functionality I wanted, so now I'll test it and improve the code :) 
 
# Credits

 - Credit goes to IC2 team for motivation and for inspiration in making this mod and Mekanism team for the ability to use their source code.
